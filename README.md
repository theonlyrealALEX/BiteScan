# _[Work in Progress]_ BiteScan - A Cross-Platform App to Quickly Identify Bug Bites on Human Skin
## Idea
What if I could tell what kind of bug bit me by taking a picture and then take an appropriate action quickly in order to prevent further damage (e.g. preventing lyme disease).
## Technology
The App will be written in Flutter. For the bite recognition I will use a standart image recognition model.
## Long Term Business Plan
- Tick vs. Mosquito Bites Model -> Proof of Concept, MVP
- Expansion to other Insects and Bite Types
- Expansion to other Dermatological Issues
